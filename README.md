## Requirements
Laddr is built on the Emergence PHP framework and deployement engine, and requires an Emergence server to host it.

Emergence takes just a few minutes to setup on a Linux VM, and is designed to have a fresh system to itself. Once launched
it will configure services on the machine as-needed to host an instance of the application along with any other
sites, clones, or child sites. The guides for Ubuntu and Gentoo are most up-to-date: http://emr.ge/docs/setup

## Installation via Emergence (linked child)
-  Create an emergence site that extends v1.laddr.io (access key: MaPG1YxorgU6ew64)

## Installation from Git
-  Create an emergence site that extends skeleton.emr.ge (access key: 8U6kydil36bl3vlJ)
-  Upload contents of git repository using WebDAV client (CyberDuck is the best open-source option)

## Vagrant

From the project root run `vagrant up` and Vagrant will download a Ubuntu 14.04 image, download the Emergence quick install script, and execute said script.

Vagrant will forward the following ports:

* 9021 = 9021
* 9023 => 9023
* 80 => 8080

You can access the emergence console on `127.0.0.1:9023`. If you have software running that is operating on port `9023` then you'll need to specify a different port to forward to.

When the box has fully initialized and you can access the emergence console then you'll be able to create a new site. Emergence has some sort of voodoo magic that can pull in the Laddr code and run it. As a note, CORS protection will prevent you from creating a user and logging in. To prevent that you'll need to provided a comma deliminated list of alernate hostnames: `localhost:8080`, `127.0.0.1:8080`. The PHP code that drives Laddr will iterate over that array.

Set the primary hostname to `127.0.0.1:80`.
